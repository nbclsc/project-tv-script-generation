    "Based on the videos/slides/papers I decided started with setting the learning rate to 0.001, embedding dimension of 50, hidden dimension of 128, and 2 RNN layers. I also started with a batch size of 200 and a sequence length of 50 (which was completely arbitrary decision). Increasing the embedding size as well as the number of hidden dimensions did have a positive impact on reducing the loss. An increase of the number of RNN layers from 2 to 3 didn’t really help, but it did have the highest % change in initial loss to end loss. Changing the learning rate to be lower or higher than 0.001 didn’t improve things either.\n",
